    Rotated logs of containerized services in /var/log/containers
    will be purged with the next containerized logrotate run
    triggered via cron, if the rotated logs have been kept longer
    than `purge_after_days` (defaults to a 14 days).

    Containerized logrotate now always compresses the rotated
    /var/log/containers logs and this can no longer be delayed
    with delaycompress. Size parameter does not honor time-based
    constraints and is disabled as not GDPR compliant. From now on,
    it configures maxsize instead. Minsize is set to a 1 byte to
    put all /var/log/containers logs under the containerized
    logrotate control.

    Forcibly purge rotated /var/log/containers logs after
    `purge_after_days` (defaults to a 14 days). New param `rotation`
    additionally allows to alter logrotate rotation interval.
    Defaults to a 'daily'. Make sure to adjust `purge_after_days` as
    needed.

    Any files in /var/log/containers, if not managed by
    the containerized logrotate, will be purged forcibly with each
    containerized logrotate run triggered via cron.
