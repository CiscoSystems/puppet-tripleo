    Logrotate's copytruncate is used by default for containerized services logs
    rotation.  The default period to keep old logs remains unchanged (14 days),
    but rotation will happen on hourly basis instead of daily. That means that
    old log files will be maintained for 336 versions of it, which represents
    14 days multiplied by 24 hours per a day.

    Containerized logrotate configuration ensures httpd processes running in
    containers will be reloaded gracefully via SIGUSR1. Containerized servicies
    will reliably reopen its logfiles when logrotate happens.
